Smart Home Electric System

## INTRODUCTION 

### Problem Statement 
The need for an efficient, user-friendly, and automated home electrical system that can be remotely controlled, optimizes energy consumption, and enhances safety.

### Proposed Solution
This project is designed to design and implement a smart home automation system using Raspberry Pi Module 3 as the central controller. Integrated PIR sensors increase energy efficiency by automatically turning on the light when people see it. Similarly, the MQ2 gas sensor and buzzer combination increases security measures by instantly activating the alarm in case of gas leakage. Additionally, the DHT11 temperature sensor provides a feeling of comfort by enabling the fan to operate when the room temperature is higher than the preset threshold. Users have the flexibility to manage these functions through the MQTT dashboard-based interface accessible from the mobile application.
